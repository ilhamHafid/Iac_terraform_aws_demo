# IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

Infrastructure as Code is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.
Automating infrastructure provisioning with IaC means that we don’t need to manually provision and manage servers, operating systems, storage, and other infrastructure components each time we develop or deploy an application.

## Approachs

There are 2 ways to approach IaC: declarative or imperative.

- Declarative approach: defines the desired state of the system, including what resources we need and any properties they should have, and an IaC tool will configure it for us(Terraform for example is based on declarative approach).
- Imperative approach: defines the specific commands needed to achieve the desired configuration, and those commands then need to be executed in the correct order.

## Benefits of IaC

With IaC, any business can manage IT infrastructure needs while improving consistency and reducing errors and manual configuration operations. Among its benefits are:
• Reduce costs
• Accelerate deployments
• Fewer errors
• Improve infrastructure consistency
• Eliminate configuration deviations
